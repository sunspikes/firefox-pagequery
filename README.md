## PageQuery for Firefox

A simple Mozilla Firefox extension to Execute a jQuery/Javascript snippet on a web page on demand and show the response. (Basically to watch for DOM changes in a web page.)

####Why this was created?
I wanted to check the wp8.1 update availability of Lumia 1020 in my country while i am at work (I just don't want to go to the support site and refresh and see every time)

####How to use?

1. Install it from [Firefox addons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pagequery/) or [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunspikes/firefox-pagequery/master/bin/pagequery.xpi)

2. Configure the web page URL and jQuery/JavaScript snippet in Addons > Extensions > PageQuery > Options after installation.

3. Once configured, click the PageQuery button from toolbar to execute the snippet.
